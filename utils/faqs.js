  // 💻 REACT NATIVE & TECHNICAL QUESTIONS
  {
    question: "How do we fetch all products from the backend in React Native?",

    answer: "Backend returns products grouped by category, or frontend filters products locally."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do we need pagination for product listing?",

  },
  {
    question: "How do we display product details on a separate screen?",
    answer: "Use React Navigation navigate('ProductDetails', { id }) and fetch product details inside that screen."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the cart work in React Native?",
    answer: "Cart is stored in Redux to persist across screens. Optionally sync to backend for logged-in users."
  },
  {

    answer: "For guests: frontend. For logged-in users: sync to backend so cart works across devices."
  },
  {
    question: "How do we prevent duplicate products from being added to cart?",
    answer: "Check if product already exists in cart. If yes → increase quantity."
  },
  {
    question: "How do we calculate total price in the cart?",

  },
  {
    question: "How do we handle product stock from backend?",
    answer: "Backend should validate stock before confirming order. Never trust frontend."

    answer: "Backend returns 409 Conflict → 'Product out of stock' → user must refresh their cart."
  },

    answer: "No — large lists will choke the app. Always search from backend."
  },
  {
    question: "How do we add product reviews?",
    answer: "POST to /products/:id/review with rating + comment. One review per user enforced by backend."
  },
  {
    question: "Why should reviews be stored separately in backend?",

  },
  {
    question: "How do we show loading while fetching products?",
    answer: "Use ActivityIndicator or a skeleton loader."
  },

    answer: "If no token → redirect user to Login screen in React Navigation."
  },
  {
    question: "How does checkout work step-by-step?",
    answer: "Validate cart → Validate stock → Create order → Process payment → Mark order as paid → Reduce stock in DB"
  },
